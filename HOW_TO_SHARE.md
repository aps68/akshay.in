# How to Share Your Website

There are two easy ways to share your website with the world for free.

## Option 1: The Easiest Way (Netlify Drop)
Great for quick sharing without creating accounts.

1.  Open your browser and search for **"Netlify Drop"** (or go to `app.netlify.com/drop`).
2.  Open your file explorer (`Win + E`) and navigate to your folder: `C:\trade`.
3.  Drag and drop the entire **`cv_website`** folder onto the Netlify Drop page.
4.  Wait a few seconds for it to upload.
5.  Netlify will give you a live link (e.g., `optimistic-beaver-123456.netlify.app`). You can share this link with anyone!

## Option 2: The Automated Way (Recommended)
I have created a script to do this for you!

1.  Open the file `setup_github.ps1` in your folder.
2.  Right-click and select **Run with PowerShell**.
3.  Follow the prompts to log in to GitHub.

## Option 3: The Manual Way (GitHub Pages)
Best if you want a permanent link and ease of updating.

1.  Create a free account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
2.  Create a **New Repository** named `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your actual GitHub username).
3.  Upload your files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and the `files` folder) to this repository.
4.  Go to **Settings > Pages** in your repository and enable GitHub Pages.
5.  Your site will be live at `https://username.github.io`.
